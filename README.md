# Named Entity Recognition Model using LSTM Network
Named Entity Recogntion (NER) is an essential step of Natural Language Processing where the entities in the textual data are recognized & classified into various categories such as Individuals, Places, Organization, etc.
Recognizing & Classifiying these entities are crucial as they aid the semantic (contextual) understanding of the textual data.

**Use Cases of NER -**
1. Search algorithms (matching search terms with the entities)
2. Content Recommendation (extracting entities from an article read by the user & searching for similar articles containing these entities for recommending to the users)
3. Customer Support (assigning complaints to relevant departments based on the location & product identified int he complaints) etc.
   
**Applications of NER -**
1. Text Summarization System
2. Question Answering System
3. Machine Translation System
4. Information Retrieval System etc.
   
**Cognitive Analytics (CA)** is the field of Analytics that leverages Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning to mimic the cognitive abilities of the human brain to analyze complex data, gain insights, recognize patterns, make future predictions etc.

**Importance of NER in CA -**
1. Extracting structured information (entities) from the unstructured/raw data like articles, websites, social media etc.
2. Extracting relevant information that enhances informed decision-making
3. Identifies entities related ot products, brands, people etc., thus aids to analyze public opinions & sentiments towards brands & products
4. Chatbots to understand the user queries by extracting the entities
5. Similar to the Chatbots, NER can also be used in Information Retrieval System to extract the relevant documents based on user's query & requirements; etc.
